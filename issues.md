 MAJOR PROBLEMS:

  1. Information Architecture Breakdown
  - The poem (core content) is buried between UI chrome
  - Ornate decorative frame consumes 25% of screen for just title/tags
  - "REVEAL INSIGHT" button sucks, it's at the bottom, but hard to see we need to get attendtoin to it and design something beautiful. Use copy like - Learn about this Poem!
  - keep debug panel, but make this drawer come up from an icon in the play bar. 
  - remove left and right navigation, use can click discover, the spaker icon is overused so we need a better 'discover' maybe use a runnig gazelle or stack of books? 
  - the explain the poem  icon and ui should be redigned, use your creative effective min

  2. Unclear Purpose & Mental Model
  - Is this a poetry reader or an AI showcase?
  - "Discover" vs navigation arrows - two competing paradigms (serendipity vs browsing) - we focus on serendipity

  - Category dropdown at top left 
  - progress indicator, if the poem scrolls, then the cotrol bar should have a progress bar that fills up as the user scrolls down. the progress bar is not there if the full poem is in view.

  - "BETA" badge twice on screen, but the beta badge on the far left top corner
  -should fee like polished product not a tech demo. think about industry (but don't compromise on the new design oor the creativeity we have)
