## Educational Content (NEW)

The walkthrough teaches 4 core concepts:

### Step 1: Sacred Patterns in Poetry

**Copy:**
> Classical Arabic poetry follows mathematical patterns called 'arud—sixteen meters governing rhythm like sacred geometry governs form

**Arabic:** العروض: هندسة الشعر العربي

**What User Learns:**
- Arabic poetry has 16 classical meters (بحور)
- These are called "arud" (العروض) - science of prosody
- Meters are as precise as geometric patterns
- Poetry has mathematical structure

---

### Step 2: The Breath of Recitation

**Copy:**
> Each verse breathes with tajweed precision—navigate through poems as you would meditate: inhale understanding, exhale wonder

**Arabic:** التجويد والتأمل في الشعر

**What User Learns:**
- Tajweed (التجويد) - rules of Quranic recitation apply to poetry
- Poetry is meant to be recited, not just read
- Recitation has a breathing rhythm
- Understanding poetry is like meditation

---

### Step 3: Layers of Meaning

**Copy:**
> Like mandalas reveal patterns within patterns, great poetry hides meanings within meanings—explore the depths with AI insights

**Arabic:** الظاهر والباطن في الشعر

**What User Learns:**
- الظاهر والباطن - apparent vs. hidden meanings (Sufi concept)
- Great poetry has multiple interpretation layers
- Deeper understanding comes from exploration
- AI can help uncover hidden meanings

---

### Step 4: Mathematical Beauty

**Copy:**
> The golden ratio in architecture, Fibonacci in nature, and metrical feet in poetry—beauty follows universal patterns

**Arabic:** النسبة الذهبية في الشعر

**What User Learns:**
- Golden ratio appears in poetry structure
- Natural patterns (Fibonacci) connect to poetic patterns
- Beauty is mathematical across all art forms
- Poetry participates in universal aesthetic laws

## Recommendation

### When to Use BEFORE (Simple)
- ❌ User already knows about Arabic poetry
- ❌ Speed is critical (e.g., returning users)
- ❌ No patience for onboarding

### When to Use AFTER (Enhanced)
- ✅ First-time users who need context
- ✅ Educational apps targeting students
- ✅ Establishing academic authority
- ✅ Creating memorable brand experience
- ✅ Building user investment in content

**Verdict:** Use AFTER for all new users. Consider adding "Skip" or "?skipSplash=true" for returning users.

---

## Conclusion

The enhancement transforms a beautiful-but-generic meditation splash into a **professor's lecture disguised as a meditation**—teaching users that:

1. Arabic poetry has mathematical structure (arud)
2. Recitation is meditative (tajweed)
3. Great poetry has hidden layers (الظاهر والباطن)
4. Beauty follows universal patterns (golden ratio)

**Result:** Users enter the main app not just knowing *how* to use it, but *why* Arabic poetry is profound.

**Achievement unlocked:** Onboarding as education, art, and meditation—simultaneously.
